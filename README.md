Raw `git diff` in a terminal is painful — no syntax colors that actually help, no side-by-side view, no file navigation, no history, no blame. You have to mentally parse it line by line.

**git-diff** opens a GitHub-quality interface in your browser — right now, from any repo, with no setup.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install git-diff
```

That's it. No npm, no node, no extra deps.

---

## Usage

```bash
# Open viewer for the current repo
cd /path/to/your/project
git-diff

# Specify a repo path
git-diff --path /path/to/repo

# Use a custom port
git-diff --port 8080

# Bind to all interfaces (share on LAN)
git-diff --host 0.0.0.0

# Don't auto-open browser (print URL only)
git-diff --no-browser

# Show 5 lines of context in diffs
git-diff --context 5

# Print version
git-diff --version
```

A browser tab opens automatically at `http://127.0.0.1:7433`.

## How it works

`git-diff` is a single Python package with **zero runtime dependencies**. It:

1. Detects your git repository root (walks up from CWD)
2. Collects all data by running `git` subprocess commands
3. Starts a tiny HTTP server using Python's built-in `http.server`
4. Serves a single-page web app with full UI
5. Opens your browser automatically
6. Exposes a `/api/*` REST endpoint for on-demand data

Everything runs **100% locally**. No data leaves your machine.

---

## API Reference

`git-diff` exposes these endpoints (accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:7433`):

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /` | The web UI |
| `GET /api/data` | Full initial data bundle (repo info, commits, diffs, etc.) |
| `GET /api/commit?hash=<sha>` | Commit diff + detail for a specific SHA |
| `GET /api/commits?branch=&limit=&offset=&search=&author=` | Paginated commit history |
| `GET /api/staged[?context=N]` | Current staged diff |
| `GET /api/unstaged[?context=N]` | Current unstaged diff |
| `GET /api/range-diff?base=<ref>&compare=<ref>` | Diff between any two refs |
| `GET /api/file?path=<path>[&ref=<ref>]` | File content at a ref |
| `GET /api/file-log?path=<path>[&limit=N]` | Commit history for a file |
| `GET /api/blame?path=<path>[&ref=<ref>]` | Blame for a file |
| `GET /api/stash?ref=<stash-ref>` | Stash diff |
| `GET /api/activity[?days=N]` | Commit activity by day |
| `GET /api/langs` | Language statistics |
| `GET /api/refresh` | Re-collect all data |
| `GET /api/git?cmd=<git-args>` | Safe read-only git passthrough |

## Supported git commands (internal)

`git-diff` internally uses these git operations to collect data:

```
git rev-parse          — detect repo root, resolve refs
git log                — commit history, activity stats, file history
git show               — commit detail, file content at ref
git diff               — staged, unstaged, commit diffs
git status             — working tree status
git blame              — line-level authorship
git stash list/show    — stash entries and diffs
git branch             — local and remote branches
git for-each-ref       — tags with metadata
git shortlog           — contributor stats
git ls-tree            — tracked file listing
git remote             — remote URLs
git rev-list           — commit counts
```

## Publishing to PyPI (for maintainers)

This project uses **PyPI Trusted Publisher** (OIDC) — no API token or password required!

### One-time setup

1. **Create the package on PyPI** (first release only):
   - Go to [pypi.org/manage/account/publishing](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/)
   - Add a new pending trusted publisher:
     ```
     PyPI project name : git-diff
     Owner             : ankit-chaubey
     Repository name   : git-diff
     Workflow filename : publish.yml
     Environment name  : pypi
     ```

2. **Create `pypi` environment** in your GitHub repo:
   - Go to repo → Settings → Environments → New environment → name it `pypi`
   - Optionally add a required reviewer for extra safety

### Publishing a new release

**Option A — GitHub Release (recommended)**
1. Go to GitHub repo → Releases → Draft new release
2. Create a tag like `v0.2.0`
3. Publish the release
4. Workflow runs automatically → published to PyPI ✅

**Option B — Manual workflow dispatch**
1. Go to Actions → "Publish to PyPI" → Run workflow
2. Enter optional new version (e.g. `0.2.0`) — auto-bumps and commits
3. Check "Dry run" to test without actually publishing
